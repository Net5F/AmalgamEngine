## The Amalgam Engine - An engine for easily creating virtual worlds

For more information, visit [worlds.place](https://worlds.place/).

## Vision
(Not all implemented yet, see [Roadmap](https://worlds.place/roadmap.html) or more detailed [Task Board](https://trello.com/b/8Z8VoAiX/amalgam-engine-tasks))
* Easily create your own isometric, sprite-based virtual world.
* Start from a template and have a full working world, including client, server, text chat, and account management.
* All needed networking is built-in, and adding new messages for your custom features is extremely easy.
* Supports 1000+ users in groups of 10, or 150+ users in 1 area, all being very active.
* Targeted for use on relatively low-spec hardware (tested on a $30/mo rented server).
* Live, in-world map editing. Use permissions to let players build things, or restrict it to your developers.

## Template Projects
### Repose
Repose is our first template project. If you'd like to make a world, you can fork Repose and use it as a fully-functioning starting point.

[Check out the project and download the latest playable release here.](https://github.com/Net5F/Repose)

## Building
Note: You rarely need to build the engine by itself, this section just provides canonical instructions. Instead, see the Template Projects section.

### Windows
#### Visual Studio (MSVC)
1. Open CMakeLists.txt in Visual Studio (`Open` -> `CMake`).
1. (Optional) Open CMakeSettings.json (in this repo) and enable `AM_BUILD_SPRITE_EDITOR` to build the sprite editor.
1. `Project` -> `Generate CMake cache` (or just let it run if you have auto-config on).
1. `Build` -> `Build All`

Note: The Sprite Editor should be built within your project, since it relies on config values from your project's Override/SharedConfig.h.

#### MinGW
For MSYS2/MinGW, we don't have a dependency install script. Here's the list:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_mixer mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_gfx mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_net mingw-w64-x86_64-catch
    
Then, build through the Eclipse project or follow the Linux instructions for a command line build.

### Linux
Note: This is only tested on Ubuntu 20.04. If you have experience in multi-distro builds, please get involved!

1. Run `Scripts/Linux/InstallDependencies.sh`, then build through the Eclipse project, or:
1. (From the base of the repo) `mkdir -p Build/Linux/Release`
1. `cd Build/Linux/Release`
1. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja ../../../`
   1. You can optionally add `-DAM_BUILD_SPRITE_EDITOR` to build the sprite editor.
1. `ninja all`

### macOS

Note: AmalgamEngine requires Clang 16 or higher to build on macOS. GCC may also work, but some optional programs will fail to build.

1. Use the Homebrew package manager to install dependencies: `brew install llvm make cmake ninja sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf sdl2_gfx sdl2_net`
1. (From the base of the repo) `mkdir -p Build/macOS/Release`
1. `cd Build/macOS/Release`
1. `CC=/path/to/llvm/bin/clang CXX=/path/to/llvm/bin/clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja ../../../`. Replace `/path/to/llvm/` in `/path/to/llvm/bin/clang` and `/path/to/llvm/bin/clang++` with the path to the version of LLVM that you installed with Homebrew (likely `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/`).
   1. You can optionally add `-DAM_BUILD_SPRITE_EDITOR` to build the sprite editor.
1. `ninja all`

## Packaging
Note: You rarely need to package the engine by itself, this section just provides canonical instructions. Instead, see the Template Projects section.

To package the applications in a way that can be shared, first run the desired build. Then, run:
```
// Assuming you're at the base of the repo.
cmake --install Build/Windows/Release --prefix Packages/Windows
```
where 'Build/Windows/Release' is your desired build to package, and 'Packages/Windows' is your desired output directory.

On Windows, you can use Visual Studio's developer terminal (`Tools` -> `Command Line` -> `Developer Command Prompt`) for easy access to CMake.

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! Feel free to work on features or bugfixes and submit PRs, they'll all be promptly reviewed. If you're looking for ways to contribute, check the [Task Board](https://trello.com/b/8Z8VoAiX/amalgam-engine-tasks).

There's a fairly solid vision for the near-future of this engine. If you would like to work on a larger feature, please make sure it's on [the roadmap](https://worlds.place/roadmap.html), or [join the discord](https://discord.gg/EA2Sg3ar74) and discuss it before getting started.
